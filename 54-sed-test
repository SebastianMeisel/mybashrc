# Interactive sed tester - preview sed changes before applying them
# Usage: tesed 's/old/new/g' filename
#
# This function:
# 1. Shows a side-by-side diff of original vs. sed-transformed content
# 2. Prompts for confirmation [y/N]
# 3. If confirmed, applies the change and creates a timestamped backup
#
# Example: tesed 's/foo/bar/g' myfile.txt
