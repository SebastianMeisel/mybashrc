# This pair of functions is a simple "output bookmarking" tool:
#
# Use-case:
#   Sometimes a command outputs a lot of lines, and you want to refer back
#   to a specific one later without running the command again.
#
# Workflow example:
#   $ ls -l /usr/bin | lout
#     1  -rwxr-xr-x  1 root root   10432 Feb  1  /usr/bin/[
#     2  -rwxr-xr-x  1 root root   88664 Feb  1  /usr/bin/awk
#     3  -rwxr-xr-x  1 root root   30888 Feb  1  /usr/bin/base32
#     ...
#   Now you’ve stored that entire output in ~/.lastout, with line numbers.
#
#   Later, if you want to re-display just line 2:
#   $ ? 2
#   -rwxr-xr-x  1 root root   88664 Feb  1  /usr/bin/awk
#
# This avoids rerunning the original command, which might be slow,
# or have non-repeatable output (e.g., network queries).

# Save piped output to ~/.lastout while numbering the lines for easy reference.
function lout () { 
    tee ~/.lastout | nl
}

# Print a specific line from the last saved output.
# Usage: ? <line_number>
function ? () { 
    awk -v LINE=$1 'NR==LINE {print $0}' ~/.lastout
}
